# Real-time Rendering of Complex Fractals

This is the DXR device source code of the **wannabe** chapter **Real-time Rendering of Complex Fractals** of **Ray Tracing Gems 2**.
The images bellow were generated running the shaders inside [Proceduray](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10357), which is the recommended way to setup the host code for those shaders.
